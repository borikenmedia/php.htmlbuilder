# php.htmlbuilder
This is a Html Builder Class Object That Like html_helper Allows the user to better understand the Html and Basic Html from a server-sided computer code sparator. Some of the most known technologies for modern web development is the aviability to separate your code your design and your techniqe. This script code is object oriented programing (oop) with php8 and Hyper Text Markup Language (Html5) with Cascade Style Sheet (CSS3) for the separation or the design UI (User Interface).

The must know techniqe or technology to assert is the Structured Programing with:
<li>Object Oriented Programing (Pragma)</li>
<li>Structured Programing (Paradigm)</li>
<li>Computer Programing (Symbol)</li><br/>
<strong>Last But Not Least</strong>
<li>Network Programing</li><br/>

The must characteristic aspect of this library is its own invoqe and <strong>_NEW</strong> Clause as the Class Object Carries varios tasks in the Object Constructor Method.

Tasks and methods like:

<code>file_get_contents($_file = "template",FILE_VALUE) (Binary-Safe)</code>
  
<code>preg_replace (posix, eregi, pcre, regex)</code>
  
<code>array _ASSOC_NUMERABLE_</code>

#Under Construction#<br/>
The provided program (Web Tool) is a php8 Library that uses a natural replacement routine with built-in methods (functions) like <i>preg_match</i>, <i>preg_replace</i> and <i>eregi_replace</i> which make a routed search of a specific value <code> func(combine[*/], replace[?$], pointer_variable) </code> matching or replacing a specific combination sequence or pattern like regular-expresion coincidence.
The recommended maturity for a machine-type development utility or built-in (e) software is somewhere near intermediate to advanced with avility to set-up a base config for web-technology and network development like Wamp (Windows, Apache2, MySQL, PHP) or Lamp (Linux, Apache2, MySQL, PHP).
